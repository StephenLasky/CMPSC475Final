This was coded in XCode 8 and built for iOS 10.
This is currently optimized ONLY for iPhone 6/6s/7 PLUS.
This represents the sample layout of the core design of adding a new workout.
At this point data is captured, but not remembered.

To see sample functionality: 
1. Scroll left or right on the yellow or red views to the desired muscle group (legs/back/etc...)
2. Once inside of the desired muscle group, use the picker views in the red view to hoose the following:
	a. Select the desired set type (bench press for example)
	b. Selected the desired weight (105.00 pounds for example)
	c. Select the number of reps performed (5 for example)
3. Drag the green bar down to the table view to add the set. Take note of the several animations that occur during this process. Try dragging the green bar somewhere other than the table view for fun.
